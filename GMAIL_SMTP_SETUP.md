## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using the **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
- Check that the email address is correct

### "Connection timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- Try port 465 instead of 587 (change `SMTP_PORT=465` and `SMTP_SECURE=true`)

### "Email not delivered"
- Check your spam folder
- Make sure the recipient email is valid
- Wait a few minutes for delivery

## Limits
